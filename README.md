# landing-page

The landing page project builds upon the markup of documents for creating and structuring the content of webpages with style sheets for the presentation and styling of documents to format the content of webpages. Given an image of the design for a webpage and a reference of the fonts and colors used for the design of the website, recreate the webpage from a blank HTML document and use  a CSS stylesheet to match the design of the original webpage.
